- Written sprint reflection

personal learning goals and take a look back on what went well/poorly during the previous sprint

During this sprint, I set out to get a good understanding of C. I think this has gone fairly well, I feel more comfortable program in C and can typically complete all of the exericises and questions with no problems. I do tend to struggle the most on learning new libraries and understanding the document associated with it. I think it would be helpful for me moving forward to comment all of the new code that I write to the fullest level so that I understand exactly what is happening on the library level.

I think that on a teaming level our group is doing well. We have been taking on most of the eduScrum ceremonies (stand-ups at the beginning of each meeting, sprint retrospectives, sprint planning, sprint review). I reviewed the answers to ThinkOS and Head First C with my team members to make sure I was ready and really quickly reviewed the chapters that we worked on. I felts fairly well-prepared for the review, but I'm worried that I won't retain this information moving forward, especially if we don't talk about it again. Hopefully, ThinkOS and Head First C will continue to touch back on earlier lessons, but I am also planning on reviewing my old answers to questions and such when I am preparing for my future sprint reviews.

As far as how I am located in the project, I feel like I am facing the issue of connecting my theoretical knowledge with actual implementation of the project. I think this partially stems from getting theoretical help from Allen in class and trying to merge that with the implementations that I have seen and the example code that I have examined. I do still think that we are in a good place, but there is still some uncertainty. I think that I have been making consistent progress on the project, which is helped by regular team meetings and check ins.
