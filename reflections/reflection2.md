# Reflection 2

## Reflection

- Going into this sprint I was hoping to continue to get comfortable with C programming and deepen my understanding of operating systems. I think that I have done very well on the first point, but I have been lagging more on the second. The exercises in C that we had to complete for this sprint I found the perfect level of challenge where I faced some difficulty with implementation, but really learned a lot in an attempt to get through that. On the second point of operating systems I have been struggling a bit more. I think this relates to getting into bigger concepts in Think OS. I have been able to get through the questions, but I'm not sure I understand enough to fully grasp the concepts and connect them. I am planning to go to Sophie's office hours next week to discuss that big picture piece. I think that a lot of people came into the class knowing more about operating systems than I did, but hopefully it won't take much to catch up.

- Teaming-wise, I believe that our team is continuing to improve. We have found that we work well when we really commit to working for long periods of time all together. I'm not sure if this is due to our team or if it has more to do with the topics that we are working on. They are so complex and take a lot of understanding to get into them that we don't get a lot done when we meet for just an hour.

- I think that the project is chugging along nicely. I am a little worried about pushing to get all of the final report piece together, but I think the team has enough time scheduled to get all of that done. I feel more comfortable with the theory/practice combination. After seeing a few implementations of what we are trying to implement, I feel better about our ability to implement it.

## Head First C

- This sprint, I have completed the readings and exercises for chapters 2.5, 3, and 4. I plan on completing chapter 5 tonight.

## Think OS & Little Book of Semaphores

- This sprint I read Think OS 4 and Little Book of Semaphores 1 & 2. I have completed the reading for Think OS 5, but I'm having some trouble with the reading questions. I plan to meet with another student to get some help with them this week.
